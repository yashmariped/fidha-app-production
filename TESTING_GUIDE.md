# 🧪 Fidha Testing Guide

## **How to Test with Real Users Only**

Your app is now configured to show **only real users** - no bots or mock users will appear in search results. Here's how to test it:

---

## **Testing Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- ✅ Firebase project connected (`fidha-app`)
- ✅ Firestore indexes deployed
- ✅ Real-time listeners active
- ✅ User presence tracking enabled

### **What's Changed**
- ❌ **No more bot users** in search results
- ✅ **Real-time user presence** tracking
- ✅ **Online/offline status** indicators
- ✅ **Activity filtering** (only shows recently active users)
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** when users go offline

---

## **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Single Device Testing**
1. **Open the app** on your device
2. **Go to "Find Someone"** screen
3. **Expected Result**: You should see "No nearby users found" because you're the only user
4. **This is correct** - the app only shows other real users, not yourself

### **Scenario 2: Two Device Testing**
1. **Open the app on Device A** (your phone)
2. **Open the app on Device B** (another phone/tablet/browser)
3. **On Device A**: Go to "Find Someone" → You should see Device B's user
4. **On Device B**: Go to "Find Someone" → You should see Device A's user
5. **Both devices** should show real-time updates

### **Scenario 3: Matching Test**
1. **On Device A**: Select a user from the list
2. **Submit outfit description** for that user
3. **On Device B**: Go to "I Was Seen" and submit a similar outfit description
4. **Expected Result**: Both devices should get a match notification
5. **Check**: Both should be able to start chatting

## **Real-Time Features to Test**

### **User Presence**
- ✅ **Online indicator**: Green dot for online users
- ✅ **Last seen**: Shows when user was last active
- ✅ **Real-time updates**: Users appear/disappear as they open/close the app

### **Matching System**
- ✅ **Outfit similarity**: Similar descriptions trigger matches
- ✅ **Mutual matching**: Both users must describe each other
- ✅ **Notifications**: Both users get notified of matches
- ✅ **Chat creation**: Automatic chat room creation

### **User Activity**
- ✅ **Activity filtering**: Only shows users active in last 10 minutes
- ✅ **Bot filtering**: Filters out users created in last 5 seconds
- ✅ **Presence tracking**: Updates when app goes to background/foreground

### **Matching Not Working**
- **Check**: Are both users submitting outfit descriptions?
- **Check**: Are the descriptions similar enough?
- **Check**: Are Cloud Functions deployed?
- **Check**: Are notifications enabled?

### **Real-Time Updates Not Working**
- **Check**: Is Firebase connection stable?
- **Check**: Are Firestore listeners active?
- **Check**: Are there any console errors?
